<h2>Dress Code</h2>
<p>Every year, students from around the world meet for two days in the General Assembly of the United Nations to participate in the UNIS/UN conference. The Student Organization Committee feels that the attire worn by each individual should reflect the level of integrity, which is synonymous with the conference.<p>

<ul>
  <li>Jeans, Sneakers, Hats, Keds, moccasins or rain boots</li>
  <li>Baggy or ripped clothing</li>
  <li>Sweatpants or athletic attire</li>
  <li>Tight, revealing clothing or see-through clothing</li>
  <li>Very high heels are not recommended</li>
  <li>Low cut back dresses</li>
</ul>

<p>Students should wear suits, knee-length skirts or dresses, or dress pants, accompanied by a jacket, dress shoes, and a collared shirt with tie if applicable. All students must have their shoulders and legs covered. Opaque leggings are only acceptable when wearing a loose dress shirt. Tights should be opaque not sheer.</p>

<p>It is also suggested that students carry only small bags, NO large bags will be permitted, as it will make security a lengthy procedure. Do not bring backpacks.</p>
