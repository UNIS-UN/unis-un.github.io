  <h1>Hosting Families</h1>

  <h2>When do we expect to receive the name and information about our students?</h2>

 <p> Visiting Schools Commission matches visiting students with UNIS families around mid February so except information to come out around that time. </p>

 <h2>My child is in T1 (14 or 15), how can we host a 17 or 18 year old?</h2> 

 <p>Although it may seem like a bad match to have a younger UNIS student matched with an older visiting student, we assure you that it will not be an issue. We have seen many cases in which this has not been a problem. If there is a problem once the student arrives, feel free to contact the Visiting Schools commission and we will do our best to help make accomodations.</p>
