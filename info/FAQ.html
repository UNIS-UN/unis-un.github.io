  <h1>Hosting Families</h1>

  <h2>When do we expect to receive the name and information about our students?</h2>

 <p> Visiting Schools Commission matches visiting students with UNIS families around mid February so except information to come out around that time. </p>

 <h2>My child is in T1 (14 or 15), how can we host a 17 or 18 year old?</h2> 

 <p>Although it may seem like a bad match to have a younger UNIS student matched with an older visiting student, we assure you that it will not be an issue. We have seen many cases in which this has not been a problem. If there is a problem once the student arrives, feel free to contact the Visiting Schools commission and we will do our best to help make accomodations.</p>

<h2>What am I meant to do while my host student is here?</h2>

<p>Typically most Visiting Schools have their own agendas therefore you most likely will not have to take them sightseeing or around NYC. However, if an advisor has not planned anything you may feel free to do so. The primary purpose of hosting is to provide a sleeping arrangement as well as breakfast and dinner for a visiting student as well as a sort of immersion into the UNIS lifestyle. This does not have to include sightseeing. Simply keep in mind that not only are Visiting Schools here for our conference but they are also here to enjoy NYC and may want to visit. </p>

<h2>When does my host student leave? Must we bring them to the airport?</h2>

<p>We only provide hosting up until the Saturday morning after the conference. You should not feel obliged to bring a student to the airport (we generally try to discourage this from happening). An advisor may set up a meeting place and time somewhere in NYC and this is where you will leave them. </p>

<h2>Can I reach out to my host child before the conference?</h2>

<p>Yes, you may contact a student via social media however, we can’t disclose visiting student email or phone number. If you would like to contact your student before you must do it yourself. </p>
