All students must have their shoulders and legs covered. Opaque leggings are only acceptable when wearing a loose dress shirt. Tights should be opaque not sheer.</p>

<p>It is also suggested that students carry only small bags, NO large bags will be permitted, as it will make security a lengthy procedure. Do not bring backpacks.</p>
