  This yearâ€™s conference title will be Megacities: A Sustainable Future. Rapid urbanization is shaping our future. We live in a world where the majority of society already lives in urban areas. As a result of rising populations and increasing migration, megacities are emerging across the globe. In order for us to achieve sustainable development, we must make significant changes in the ways in which we build and manage our urban environments. The 2020 UNIS-UN conference will examine the implications of the increasing concentration of population, goods, and services seen in these urban areas. We will investigate the role of government as well as the roles of AI and surveillance. In addition, we will explore the vulnerability faced by cities regarding environmental threats, and discuss how we can work to make cities resilient against them.
