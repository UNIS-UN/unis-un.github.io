      <h1> WELCOME TO UNIS-UN </h1>
      <p> Welcome to the UNIS-UN Website! Our goal as an organization is to provide an educationally and intellectually enriching experience for our peers from around the world while promoting globalism and cross-cultural exchange.</p>

      <p>We host an annual conference relating to a contemporary global issue. We invite expert and engaging speakers that are well versed on the topic who present to our audience of 700 high school students from International Schools from 5 continents. For the past 40 years it has been held in the General Assembly Hall at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City. </p>
        
      <p>To the end of promoting global awareness and cross-culturalism, the annual themes are always ones of global importance. Over three hundred students from all over the world are invited to attend in addition to the upper classes at the United Nations International School. This is our second year that there will be a half day international celebration featuring international performances and a cultural showcase in the Sylvia Howard Fuhrman Auditorium at UNIS.</p>

<h1><!--UPCOMING--> 2018 CONFERENCE</h1>
    <p>This year’s conference topic will be Under CTRL: Technology, Innovation and the Future of Work. We will be exploring present innovations and the possible social and political implications. It is clear technology is already shaping our lives significantly, in terms of production, energy use, development and security. The 2018 UNIS-UN conference will explore questions regarding the way in which innovations will improve not only lifestyle, but also efforts in development. We will investigate how our increasing use of technology may also be a risk to our privacy, and the profound social and political effects, the rapid rise in automation may have on future generations of workers. As ambassadors for the future, these issues will have the greatest impact on our own lives, and therefore, it is critical that we develop a deeper understanding of these issues and how to address them properly.</p>
<h2>Issues</h2>
<ol>
    <li>How will innovations improve lifestyle, help in development and in creating a more sustainable future?</li>
    <li>What are some of the risks of relying so much on technology and data which can fall into the wrong hands?</li>
    <li>What does automation mean for the jobs of many? What are the political and social consequences? What can we do instead/ what are the solutions?</li>
</ol>
